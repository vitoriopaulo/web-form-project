# Web Form Feedback App

Welcome to the **Web Form Feedback App**, the front-end interface for the first project in the freeCodeCamp curriculum. This application is designed to facilitate user feedback collection through intuitive web forms.

## Overview

This project emphasizes fundamental UX/UI design principles, focusing on:

- **Information Architecture**: Structuring content effectively for user navigation.
- **Usability**: Ensuring the application is easy to use and understand.
- **Visual Design**: Creating an aesthetically pleasing interface that enhances user experience.
- **Accessibility**: Designing for inclusivity, ensuring usability for all users, including those with disabilities.

Originally intended to use only HTML and CSS, this project has evolved to include JavaScript functionalities to enhance interactivity and user engagement. The goal was to achieve a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with a focus on user feedback and data collection.
