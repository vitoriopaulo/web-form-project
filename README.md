Web Form Feedback App
This project is the front-end page for the first project in the freeCodeCamp Web Design Certificate.

Designed with the fundamental principles of UX/UI design, this page focuses on:

Information Architecture
Usability
Visual Design
Accessibility
The goal of this project was to achieve the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with simplicity and clarity. While initially intended to be built using only HTML and CSS, the project extends beyond these requirements by incorporating JavaScript. This enhancement adds interactivity, such as a pop-up confirmation upon clicking the "Submit" button to acknowledge successful form submission.

We aimed for a straightforward approach, prioritizing core design principles over elaborate styling.

Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
