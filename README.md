# Web Form Feedback App

This is the front-end page for the first project in the freeCodeCamp Web Design Certificate.

## Overview

This project emphasizes fundamental UX/UI design principles, focusing on:

- **Information Architecture**
- **Usability**
- **Visual Design**
- **Accessibility**

While originally intended to use only HTML and CSS, this project also incorporates JavaScript to enhance interactivity. Specifically, a pop-up confirmation appears upon clicking the "Submit" button, indicating successful form submission.

The goal was to achieve a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with a focus on simplicity and clarity, without adding elaborate styling.
