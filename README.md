This is the Front-end page for the First project of the freeCodeCamp Web Design certificate. 
The page is unpretensious: was coded within attention to the basics fundamentals of UX/UI Design, 
Information Architecture, Usability, Visual Design and accessibility matters in mind. 
A prroject done to successfully achieve the MVP, with unpretensious goal of doing anything more 
fancy or glamorous regarding styling. The project, which was suposed to be done only with HMTL and CSS, goes beyond the requirements for succesfully achieving the MVP: a javascript code was added to give the page a bit of interactivite, with the pop up appearing after "Sbmit" button click to confirm the form was succesfully sent.
Hope you enjoyed the result.
Sweet!
